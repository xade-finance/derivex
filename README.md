# DeriveX

## Introduction

DeriveX is an upcoming synthetic tokenized derivatives platform that provides perpetual futures (future contracts that never expire) for 5000+ markets(Crypto, Forex, Commodities, Global Equities) in a completely decentralized manner on top of the Celo Blockchain developed by Xade Labs. Xade Labs is the R&D arm of XADE.

XADE is a De-Fi service provider that uses the best De-fi protocols while providing the user experience of a Neo-bank.

XADE will be the exchange provider for DeriveX. We aim at creating the world's best, most accessible, and most secure decentralized derivatives trading platform and solve the issues in the current traditional derivatives market by providing a hybrid solution between Exchange Traded Derivatives(ETD) and Over The Counter Derivatives(OTC) through Defi. All trades in Derivex are settled in Celo USD(cUSD) but we will be adding support for more stablecoins and cryptos in the future. DeriveX acts as a decentralized clearinghouse and uses vAMM(virtual Automated Market Makers) to provide low slippage and good liquidity with instant settlement and close to zero fees due to Celo Blockchain
